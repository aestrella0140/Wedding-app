      Our journey together started all the way back in Pre-K at Killip Elementary, and from the very beginning, we were inseparable. We continued into Kindergarten together at South Beaver Elementary, where, on the first day, Tatiana’s dad jokingly (or maybe seriously) told me to protect his daughter. That small moment set the foundation for a lifelong connection.

Even as little kids, we were always partners in crime. We loved playing at the water tub, and we refused to let any of the other kids have a turn. Our friendship stayed strong through first grade when we had the same teacher, though Tatiana was always ahead of the class while I (Adrian) was still struggling to read. Then, life took us in different directions—I moved away after first grade, and for years, we didn’t see each other.

That all changed in eighth grade. Our parents, who had mutual friends, got together one night, and by chance, we found ourselves hanging out at the local park. It was the first time we had seen each other in years, but it felt like no time had passed. That night is also when we both witnessed one of my dad’s funniest drunk moments—while trying to get him into the car, he told us he had a secret. When we leaned in, expecting something big, he just grumbled in a deep voice, “I’m Batman.”

From then on, Tatiana started hanging out with my sister and me on the weekends, and over time, we got closer. It started with small things—sitting next to each other a little longer, lingering conversations, and eventually, secretly holding hands when no one was looking. One night, while we were sitting on the couch, my dad was sleeping but happened to wake up and see us holding hands. He didn’t say anything at the moment, but the next day, he made sure to let us know he had caught us.

Going into freshman year, we officially started dating for the first time. It lasted about a month… and then I (Adrian) completely crashed and burned our relationship. I was awkward, didn’t know how to talk to Tatiana, and, well, I was pretty boring. But even after that, we remained friends—though we didn’t talk much during freshman year. By sophomore year, we reconnected as friends, but with both of us involved in sports and clubs, we never really had time to hang out outside of school.

Junior year was even busier. Tatiana was working at Starbucks, doing Honor Guard, and balancing all honors classes, while I was focused on training for wrestling and recovering from a torn ACL. That summer, I had the opportunity to join Uncle Richard’s Young Lions team for Greco-Roman wrestling and spent my time training in Denmark and Germany. We barely saw each other that whole year.

Then, more than halfway through senior year, something changed. A mutual friend decided to start pulling the strings to get us back together. Eventually, we went on our first official date—Castles and Coasters. It was supposed to be a double date with my sister and her boyfriend, but they dropped out at the last minute. I was so nervous that I begged my sister to come anyway, but luckily, she and Tatiana were already friends, so she tagged along. That night was special—it felt effortless, like we had known each other forever, and from that point on, we were always together.

Every weekend, we were either at hookah lounges or hanging out at our friends’ houses, making the most of our last few months of high school. But as graduation got closer, reality set in. Tatiana wanted to join the Air Force, while I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. In the end, we both decided to start working instead of heading straight into school. I started working at Gore, and for a while, we settled into a routine—me at Gore, Tatiana at Starbucks.

Then COVID hit. Everything changed, and suddenly, we were spending all of our time together. Tatiana left Starbucks and started working at Gore, too. When our first anniversary came around, we decided to get an Airbnb in Prescott, AZ, for a weekend getaway. It was supposed to be a romantic trip, but the moment we arrived, we realized that Prescott wasn’t exactly the most diverse place. People stared at us like we didn’t belong, and we quickly decided to spend most of our time inside instead of exploring the town. But honestly, that made the trip even more special—we cooked for each other, had deep conversations, and created some of our favorite memories.

On the second to last day, we planned to drive up to Sedona. Somehow, we accidentally took the back route through Jerome and Cottonwood, which led to some of the steepest roads we had ever driven on—right as thick fog rolled in. At one point, our brakes were so hot we could smell them. But we made it, and once we got to Sedona, the stress of the drive was worth it. It was another perfect day.

After that, the world went into full lockdown. But we didn’t mind. We spent every single day together, growing closer than ever.

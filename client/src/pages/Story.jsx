      <h2>How it began</h2>
      <p>
        Our journey began long before we even realized it. We first met in Pre-K
        at Killip Elementary and continued into Kindergarten at South Beaver
        Elementary. On the very first day, Tatiana’s dad told Adrian to protect
        his daughter—a responsibility he took seriously, even if it mostly meant
        playing together at the water tub and not letting the other kids have a
        turn. We stayed friends through first grade, sharing a teacher and many
        fun moments, even though Tatiana was always ahead of the class while
        Adrian was still learning to read. Life took us in different directions
        after first grade, and we lost touch. It wasn’t until eighth grade that
        fate brought us back together. Our parents, who were mutual friends, got
        together one night, and for the first time in years, we saw each other
        again. That night, we hung out at the local park, and as our parents
        enjoyed their drinks, Adrian’s dad—completely drunk—declared in his best
        Batman voice that he had a secret… he was Batman. It was a hilarious
        moment that marked the beginning of our renewed friendship. Tatiana
        started hanging out with Adrian’s sister, and soon, she was coming over
        every weekend, strengthening the bond between us.
      </p>
      <h2>reconnecting</h2>
      <p>
        During those visits, Adrian and Tatiana grew closer, secretly holding
        hands when no one was looking. One night, while sitting on the couch
        holding hands, Adrian’s dad woke up and saw us but said nothing until
        the next day. Leading up to freshman year, we finally started
        dating—though only for about a month. Adrian, being awkward and not
        knowing how to talk to Tatiana, unintentionally crashed and burned the
        relationship by simply being too quiet. Despite this, we remained
        friends, though not as close during freshman year. By sophomore year, we
        reconnected and talked as friends again. With both of us busy in sports
        and clubs, we didn’t hang out often, but it was nice to have each other
        to talk to. Junior year got even busier—Tatiana took on Starbucks, honor
        guard, and honors classes, while Adrian was focused on wrestling,
        recovering from a torn ACL, and training for Greco-Roman wrestling. That
        summer, Adrian joined Uncle Richard’s Young Lions team, training in
        Denmark and Germany. We barely saw each other, but toward the end of
        senior year, our paths crossed again.
      </p>
      <h2>realigning</h2>
      <p>
        With a little help from a mutual friend playing matchmaker, we finally
        went on our first real date. Castles and Coasters was supposed to be a
        double date with Adrian’s sister and her boyfriend, but they bailed last
        minute. Nervous as ever, Adrian begged his sister to still come along.
        Fortunately, Tatiana and Gabby were already friends, so she tagged along
        instead. From that day, we were inseparable. We spent every weekend
        together, going to hookah lounges and hanging out at friends' houses.
      </p>
      <h2>New beginings</h2>
      <p>
        As graduation neared, we started planning for the future. Tatiana wanted
        to join the Air Force, while Adrian was unsure of his next steps. We
        both started working—Tatiana at Starbucks and Adrian at Gore. When COVID
        hit, Tatiana joined Gore too, bringing us even closer. Our one-year
        anniversary came, and we decided to get an Airbnb in Prescott, AZ. The
        trip was memorable—not just because of our time together, but also
        because of the odd stares we received from locals. Feeling out of place,
        we stayed inside, cooking for each other and having deep conversations.
        On our second-to-last day, we took a trip to Sedona but accidentally
        drove the back way through Jerome and Cottonwood. The thick fog and
        steep roads were nerve-wracking, and our brakes overheated, but we made
        it safely and had an amazing time.
      </p>
      <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>
        During the lockdown, we found comfort in each other and binge-watched
        countless anime and Studio Ghibli movies—films we still rewatch today.
        However, this time was also difficult. Adrian’s dad fell seriously ill,
        and we spent most of our time at his parents’ house helping take care of
        him. On April 9, 2021, Adrian’s dad passed away, a loss that deeply
        impacted us all but ultimately brought our families closer.
      </p>
      <h2>Hard Times</h2>
      <p>
        A few months later, we decided to get a dog together. Bruno, a tiny
        4-pound Maltese mix, became our first pet. Unfortunately, he had parvo,
        and we rushed him to the emergency vet multiple times, doing everything
        we could to save him. One night, after another vet visit, we were so
        overwhelmed that we called our moms while pulling out of the clinic’s
        parking lot. Just as we waited at a green light, we were t-boned—our
        first car accident, with our moms hearing everything on the phone. Bruno
        passed away two days later, leaving us heartbroken.
      </p>
      <h2>Vegas!</h2>
      <p>
        For our third anniversary, we took our first out-of-state trip together
        to Las Vegas, staying at The D Resort. We had no luck gambling but loved
        the live bands on Fremont Street. We explored the Mob Museum and planned
        a fun night out on our last day but ended up exhausted, watching the
        SpongeBob movie instead. Still, it was an unforgettable trip.
      </p>
      <h2>The Big Question</h2>
      <p>
        By our fourth anniversary, Adrian had big plans. While in Modesto, CA,
        for family matters, he secretly arranged a surprise picnic at Boise
        Thompson Ranch, a beautiful tree farm. Adrian’s sister, Gabby, was in on
        it, secretly recording as Adrian got down on one knee and proposed.
        <strong>Tatiana said yes!</strong> Her engagement ring, featuring a
        stunning Tsavorite garnet gem, was the perfect symbol of our journey
        together.
      </p>
      <h2>Friends</h2>
      <p>
        Shortly after, Adrian took a Full Stack Web Development course through
        ASU, changing shifts at work, while Tatiana got a new car she absolutely
        loved. Not long after, we got a French bulldog named Chapo. He is our
        baby, and although he has a lot of vet bills, he is the love of our
        lives, and everyone adores him. He is a brat, but he is so loving,
        always making us laugh with his antics and snorts. We became more
        involved with our growing friend group and planned our first group trip
        for Tequila Sunrise in Flagstaff. We all rented an Airbnb and spent the
        weekend bar-hopping, with Collins Bar becoming our favorite spot.
        Walking back home drunk was an adventure, but it was one of the best
        times we’d had.
      </p>
      <h2>present</h2>
      <p>
        For our fifth anniversary, we planned a trip to Tucson, exploring
        downtown, visiting quirky shops, and simply enjoying each other’s
        company. As we look back on our journey—from childhood friends to high
        school sweethearts, from struggles to celebrations—we know that every
        moment has led us to where we are today. And we wouldn’t change a single
        thing.
